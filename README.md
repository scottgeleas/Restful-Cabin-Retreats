  ## Description / Objective
  We created the RESTful Cabin Retreats application to demonstrate our ability to design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku. The application is in designed and built app using the MVC paradigm, our own server-side API, add user authentication, and database connection. We collaborated via Zoom and Slack, used Git branching workflow and Agile software development methodology.

  ### Screen Captures
  Image of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to show the data model and the relationships. The ERD was created wtih DrawSQL. (https://drawsql.app/home)

  ## Project 2 Requirements (from assignment README.md)
  * Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
  * Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
  * Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
  * Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
  * Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
  * Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
  * Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
  * Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
  * Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
  * Have a polished UI.
  * Be responsive.
  * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
  * Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
  * Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)

  ## User Story 
   ```md
  AS A person seeking a quiet retreat
  I WANT to stay in a cabin somewhere in the world
  SO THAT I can rejuvenate my mind and body.
  ```

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ```md
  GIVEN a global cabin rental site
  WHEN I visit the site for the first time
  THEN I am presented with the homepage, where I can log in or signup and navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard
  WHEN I choose to sign up 
  THEN I am prompted to create a username and password
  WHEN I click on the sign-up button
  THEN my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site
  THEN I am prompted to enter my username and password
  WHEN I am signed in to the site
  THEN I see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to make a reservation or log out
  WHEN I click on the make a reservation button
  THEN I am presented with a calendar to select the begining and ending of my desired cabin stay
  THEN I am presented with an option to select a region of the world and a country
  THEN I am presented with the available cabins in that country/region
  WHEN I select a cabin 
  THEN I am presented with details about the cabin including occupancy (what else?) and an image of the cabin if an image is available
  WHEN I click on reserve cabin button
  THEN I am presented with a message that indicating my reservation was successful
  THEN I am able to view my reservation on the updated dashboard
  WHEN I click on the logout option in the navigation
  THEN I am signed out of the site
  WHEN I am idle on the site for more than a set time
  THEN I am able to view my dashboard but I am prompted to log in again before I can make an additional reservation  
  ```
  ## Key Features 
  The key features of this application include:

  * A responsive site with a visually stunning user interface
  * Robust seed data for a realistic demo experience
  * User-friendly login and signup functionality
  * A dynamic calendar for selecting duration of cabin stay
  * Capabilities to search region/country for available cabins
  * A user dashboard that enables users to view thier reservations

  ## Tools
  The tools used to create this application include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySql, Node, Sequelize, Bcrypt, Dotenv, Express, Express-handlebars, Express-session, Heroku, Github, Git Bash, and Visual Studio Code.

  ## Installation
  The following packages were installed:

  - [Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package is used to implement Handlebars.js for Views.
  - [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages are used to connect to a MySQL database for the Models, and create an Express.js API for Controllers.
  - [Dotenv Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is used for environment variables.
  - [Bcrypt Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is used to hash passwords.
  - [Connect-Session-Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) package adds authentication.
  - [Express-Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package adds authentication and stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and nothing is required other than other than implementing the npm package.
